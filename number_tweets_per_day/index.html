    <p>The graph below shows the collected tweets per day. One can see a general trend with a peak at the first election round on 23 April, 2017 and one day after. I had changed the words to track over time, so I can’t conclude for sure that the amount had actually increased, the closer we came to the first election round.The second graph shows the number of tweets per day which I’ve collected until I stopped the data collection. Not surprisingly, the number of tweets reached its peak on the day after the Emmanuel Macron was elected President. I had not allocated enough memory to the program that makes me believe the actual number was quite higher and there were tweets that did not match my search pattern. The subsequent weeks the number declined sharply.</p>

<p>During the last weeks of my stay in Toulouse, from September 2016 to mid April 2017, it has come to me that the upcoming presidential elections in France would be a nice occassion to approach the whole issue of mining and analysing tweets again. Luckily, I’ve found the time to accomplish a setup with python, around two weeks ahead of the first election round, that automatically collects tweets which match keywords. In the sub pages you find some basic analysis of the collected data.</p>

<h2 id="guide-for-toulouse2"><a href="https://felixidelberger.shinyapps.io/Guide_Toulouse/">Guide for Toulouse</a></h2>
<p>I’ve created a guide for people who want to discover the City of Toulouse. The guide features the possibility to select a category of interest and displays the respective entries in table and on a map. Users can enter their home address and the app calculates the distance to each location and displays the home on the map as well. I’ve realized the guide using R, mostly using shiny and leaflet.</p>

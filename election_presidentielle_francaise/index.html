    <h1 id="basic-setup">Basic Setup</h1>
<p>I had used R in the past to collect tweets, but this technique has its limitations, when one wants to collect a lot of data and do so 24/7. In my opinion there is no way around Python in this case and in the best case a server is at hand as well. It is the first time I am using this combination, I did some research to find a setup that is fast, since I was expecting a lot of tweets around the election days. My setup is based on this great <a href="https://github.com/dataquestio/twitter-scrape">twitter scraper repo</a>. In the first days I only had a few words to track specified, but adjusted my list based on a simple preliminary analysis of collected data.</p>
<p>In the following sub pages I present some basic analysis of collected tweets in the light of the presidential elections in France.</p>
<h1 id="track-terms">Track terms</h1>
<p>these are the terms for which Twitter’s API was looking in tweets to forward matches.</p>
<ul>
<li>“presidentielle2017”, “presidentielles2017”, “presidentielle”, “presidentielles”, “#France2017”, “#Frenchelections”</li>
<li>“Fillon”, “Fillon2017”, “projetfillon”, “jevotefillon”, “fillongate”,”francoisfillon”</li>
<li>“Hamot”, “Hamot2017”,</li>
<li>“LePen”, “Le Pen”, “marielepen”, “marine2017”, “#mlp”,</li>
<li>“Macron”, “enmarche”, “macron2017”, “jevotemacron”, “emmanuelmacron”</li>
<li>“Melenchon”, “jlm2017”, “jlmelenchon”,</li>
<li>“Arthaud”,</li>
<li>“Poutou”,</li>
<li>“Asselineau”, “Asselineau2017”,</li>
<li>“Dupont-Aignan”, “DupontAignan”,</li>
<li>“Lassalle”,</li>
<li>“Cheminade”</li>
</ul>
<p>In total my dataset contains 8,783,948 tweets.</p>
